# Day-Planner
AS an employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
Eatch time I insert text in the box, and then save, it will show the same text after refresh. 
The hours are 9 am - 5 pm just like work hours.
The current day will show on top.
The colors represent the past, present, or future.
